# Compiler
This is the compiler I made during my semester in Compiler Design and Construction. It reads code (.txt file) written according to the syntax of a language called "Java 0" and produces the assembly language equivalent. The generated assembly code is meant to be used on a 32-bit distribution of Linux.
