# Compiler
This is the compiler I made during my semester in the Compiler Design and Construction course at SHSU. It accepts code (.txt file) written according to the syntax of a language called "Java 0" and produces its assembly language equivalent. The generated assembly code is meant to be used on a 32-bit distribution of Linux.
