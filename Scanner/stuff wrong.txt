STUFF WRONG W/ COMPILER

1. firstPassDFSA doesn't recognize RELOP, but creating symbol table still works.
This is likely due to the function tokenToNumeric returning either a C++ default value OR
it's keeping the numeric value of the symbol before the RELOP. Since this could only be
an integer or var, shouldn't be a problem.

2. The comment /***/ gets the scanner stuck in an infinite loop. Any odd number of stars that
immediately follow /* and immediately precede */ will cause this.

3. Currently there is mismatch between program name classification btwn token list and symbol table (i.e. pgm1 => var in TL, => ProgramName in ST)
